iOS TrustMe
===========

An extreme method of disabling most certificate verification checks within iOS applications.
TrustMe will defeat certificate pinning in most cases. 

Description
-----------

Requires a jailbroken device. This "Tweak" disables the SecTrustEvaluate. It should
only be used on testing devices with no personal data or information, since this 
will completely disable most SSL safeguards. 

Requirements
------------
 * MobileSubstrate (Should come with jailbroken devices)
 * dpkg (Install from Cydia)

Installation
------------
Download the dpkg 

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/masbog/trustme/master/com.intrepidusgroup.trustme_0.1-4_iphoneos-arm.deb

	dpkg -i com.intrepidusgroup.trustme_0.1-4_iphoneos-arm.deb

Usage
------------
To disable it, uninstall the deb:

	dpkg -r com.intrepidusgroup.trustme

Alternately, you can edit the plist located at /Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/trustme.plist

Documentation on the format of the plist can be found at

Build
-----------
Building requires theos.

This is a Theos 'tweak' project. Use theos to create the required files and then run:

	make

Acknowledgements
-----------
This tool is patterned on ios-ssl-kill-switch (https://github.com/iSECPartners/ios-ssl-kill-switch). Trustme 
uses a similar technique, but targets a C function that is lower in the call chain of most SSL certificate
validation code, which allows it to disable more SSL validation code.
